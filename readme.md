# Canvas Balls

Useless bouncing balls on a canvas

## Getting Started

First you have to include the js script
```html
<script src="Balls.js"></script>    
```
Then your html file you need to create a div

```html
<div id="balls"></div>      
```
To initiate the canvas
```javascript
 var balls = new Balls(
     {
        selector:"#balls",
        nbBalls:20,
        speed:null,
        backgroundBalls:null,
        addOnClick:true
});
```
This code will create a canvas with 20 balls with a random speed and a random color on a black background.
